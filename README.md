# Surface-Profilometer-data-analysis
Code to calculate Roughness (RMS &amp; Average) of a sample and Thickness of a coating using Surface Profilometer. The data (lateral and height) is loaded as two separate arrays and the script is run to get the output. This is the code written for one of my assignments of undergrad mechanical engineering.
